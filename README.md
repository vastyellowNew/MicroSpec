## Microspec: Speculation-centric fine-grained parallelization for fsm computations

MicroSpec is a set of parallelization techniques that, for the first time, expose fine-grained speculative parallelism to FSM computations.


#### Compilation

To compile MicroSpec, just run *make* in the src directory.

#### Testing MicroSpec

In the test folder, we have provided some simple test cases and the example bash scripts.
Just need to run 

```
$ ./test/run_example.sh
```
